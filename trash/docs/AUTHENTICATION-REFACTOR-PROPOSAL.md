## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Current Architecture Issues**
```typescript
// CURRENT PROBLEMATIC CODE
export function isAuthenticated(request: NextRequest): boolean {
  const authToken = getAuthCookie(request)
  return !!authToken  // ❌ ONLY CHECKS EXISTENCE, NO VERIFICATION
}

// Manual cookie management
document.cookie = `jlpt4you_auth_token=${session.access_token}; ...`  // ❌ XSS RISK
```

### **Proposed New Architecture**
```typescript
// NEW SECURE IMPLEMENTATION
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const supabase = createServerClient(/* config */)
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()  // ✅ PROPER VERIFICATION
  
  if (isProtectedRoute && !user) {
    return NextResponse.redirect('/login')
  }
}
```

### **Key Technical Changes**
1. **Replace custom middleware** with Supabase SSR middleware
2. **Eliminate manual cookie management** - let Supabase handle it
3. **Standardize API authentication** across all endpoints
4. **Implement proper token refresh** automatically
5. **Add comprehensive error handling** and logging
