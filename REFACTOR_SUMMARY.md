## 🏗️ Architecture Transformation

### Before (Monolithic)
```
ChatLayout.tsx (1364 lines)
├── AI Provider Management
├── Chat State Management  
├── UI State Management
├── Message Handling
├── File Processing
├── LocalStorage Operations
├── Error Handling
└── Navigation & Auth
```

### After (Modular)
```
ChatLayout.tsx (157 lines)
├── useAIProvider.ts (120 lines)
├── useChatManager.ts (180 lines)
├── useUIState.ts (150 lines)
├── useMessageHandler.ts (140 lines)
├── useLocalStorage.ts (130 lines)
├── useStreamingResponse.ts (200 lines)
├── useFileHandler.ts (160 lines)
└── ChatLayoutHeader.tsx (150 lines)
```

## 🔧 Created Components & Hooks

### Core Hooks
1. **`useAIProvider`** - AI provider switching & model selection
2. **`useChatManager`** - Chat CRUD operations & persistence
3. **`useUIState`** - UI state management & responsiveness
4. **`useMessageHandler`** - Message operations & AI responses

### Utility Hooks
5. **`useLocalStorage`** - Type-safe localStorage operations
6. **`useStreamingResponse`** - Streaming AI responses with throttling
7. **`useFileHandler`** - File processing & validation

### Components
8. **`ChatLayoutHeader`** - Memoized header component

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### React Optimizations
- ✅ `React.memo` for component memoization
- ✅ `useCallback` for stable function references
- ✅ `useMemo` for expensive computations
- ✅ `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth streaming updates

### Memory Management
- ✅ Proper cleanup in useEffect
- ✅ AbortController for request cancellation
- ✅ Throttled updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- ✅ Minimal dependency arrays
